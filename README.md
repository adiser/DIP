# CNN: Medical Image Diagnosis Using Deep Learning Neural Network

## DIP-31
<Add project description here>

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
- Python 3.5.x or latest
- Pytorch v0.1.12
- PIL
- Scikit-learn
- Everything in the requirement.txt

## DEPENDENCIES INSTALLATION
Easy and simple. Just use `pip install`.

#### Pytorch v0.1.12
For the purpose of reproducibility, we suggest you to install pytorch v0.1.12 or latest stable version. Installing pytorch is as easy as:

```
$ pip install http://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-0.4.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
$ pip install torchvision
```
However, note that different platform might have different pip command. Please refer to the [original site](https://pytorch.org/) for PyTorch Build for your platform. You can also opt for CUDA supported package if you plan to use GPU.

#### Pillow (PIL) 5.3.x
The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities. We use this mainly for image augmentation to enhance the robustness of our model.

```
$ pip install Pillow
```

#### Scikit-learn
Simple tool for data mining and data analysis. We will use this mainly for K-fold Cross validation (stratified). 

``` 
$pip install scikit-learn 
```

#### Others
``` 
$pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

And there you go!

## Usage
